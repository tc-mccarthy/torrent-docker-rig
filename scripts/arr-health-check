# arr-health-check: Health check script for Sonarr/Radarr/Bazarr/Overseerr containers
# -------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# This script verifies that the container is connected to the internet via VPN (NordLynx),
# and optionally refreshes download clients if an API key is provided. It uses a lock file
# to prevent redundant checks and logs all output for debugging. VPN status is determined
# by sourcing vpn_utils.sh and calling check_vpn_protection().
#
# - Logs all output to /scripts/$SERVICE_NAME-health-check.log
# - Uses a lock file to avoid redundant checks; lock file must be no more than 10 minutes old
# - Checks VPN status using a shared utility function
# - Exits 0 if VPN is up, 1 if not
