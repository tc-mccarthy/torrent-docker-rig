# vpn-health-check: Health check script for NordLynx VPN container
# ---------------------------------------------------------------
# This script verifies that the container is connected to the internet via NordLynx VPN.
# It logs the check, prevents rapid repeated checks with a lock file, and marks the container
# as unhealthy if VPN protection is not detected. Intended for use as a Docker healthcheck.
#
# - Logs all output to /scripts/vpn-health-check.log
# - Uses a lock file to avoid redundant checks
# - Checks VPN status via NordVPN's public API
# - Exits 0 if VPN is up, 1 if not
# ---------------------------------------------------------------

# Log the current timestamp for traceability
TIMESTAMP=$(date)
echo "$TIMESTAMP" > /scripts/vpn-health-check.log

# Lock file logic: Only skip health check if a lock file exists and is 10 minutes old or younger.
LOCK=$(find /scripts -iname "vpn-health-check.lock" -mmin -10 | wc -l)

if [[ "$LOCK" != "0" ]]; then
    echo ">> LOCK file is less than or equal to 10 minutes old. SKIPPING HEALTHCHECK >>" >> /scripts/vpn-health-check.log
